# Filewalker

This is just an additional task for my Java Core lecture in Insart IT Academy. 

The FileWalker provides recursively search for files in specified directory with specified extension, then it searches for some string with a provided word in those files using several threads.

The task is the following: you have to find out as much gaps in project as possible, sugest better solution (and show it your own project), compare and describe pros and cons of those approaches. 

The form of the report doesn't matter.

Good Luck!
